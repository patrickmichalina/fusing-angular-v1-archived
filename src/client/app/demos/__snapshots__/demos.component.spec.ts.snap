      Certain things can be difficult when trying to achieve pure isomorphism. This page showcases these solved issues.

    <h3>
      Caching Server XHR Requests
    </h3>
    <p>
      Don't make a second API request when the data was retrieved from the server already. This produce "flicker-free" responses. Reload this page and pay attention to how the list below does not flicker.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      SVGs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Server rendered SVGs are very effecient. They are also flicker free! But having a large set of SVGs stored in an angular service penalizes users by making them download a large app bundle. In order to fix this, we provide a server and client variant of the SVG service. Initial rendered SVGs come from the server and client routed SVGs are an async fetch.
